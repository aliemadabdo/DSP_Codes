# labs and projects for DSP (digital signal processing) course EEC-371

###lab 3 is about image compression using discrete cosine transform (DCT)
The DCT works by separating images into parts of differing frequencies. During a step called quantization, where part of compression actually occurs, the less important frequencies are discarded
